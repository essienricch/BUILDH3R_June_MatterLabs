The Scale Of History On Account Abstraction (AA) 

Introduction - 
zkSync Era is a Layer 2 ZK rollup, a trustless protocol that uses cryptographic validity proofs to provide scalable and low-cost transactions on Ethereum. In zkSync Era, computation is performed off-chain and most data is stored off-chain as well. Transactions are bundled into batches before generating a validity proof. As all validity proofs are proven on Ethereum, users enjoy the same security warranties as in the L1.
zkSync Era is made to look and feel like Ethereum, but with a higher throughput and lower fees. Just like on Ethereum, smart contracts are written in Solidity/Vyper and can be called using the same clients as in other EVM-compatible chains.

Overview-
- I was tasked to Build a smart contract to exchange messages with Zeek.
- Deploy the smart contract to the zkSync Sepolia Testnet.
- Interact with the contract from your browser using Remix or Atlas.

Prerequisites-
- MetaMask: A browser extension wallet to manage your Ethereum accounts.
- An online IDE for developing, deploying, and managing smart contracts. e.g Atlas, Remix.

  Refer to the docs of zkSync: https://docs.zksync.io/build/quick-start for steps on how to achieve this task
